clicks * cr = sales
bid * clicks = cost

Impressions is the number of times an ad is displayed.  It is the main y
value and together with ctr and cr it is used to calculate clicks and sales.

CTR is the click-through-rate, how often an impression leads to a click.
impressions * CTR = clicks

CR is the conversion rate, how often a click leads to a sale:
clicks * CR = sales
therefore
impresstions * CTR * CR = sales

We are trying to optimize for the highest number of sales within the
given budget.
